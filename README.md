Ever needed to find which file provides you the `printf` function? Do you want to recompile a package that defines a symbol on your system?
Welcome to SymbolFinder. You can choose between `nm` and `scanelf` to scan what you are looking for. Just enter the symbol's name and if your
system has a library file that defines or references it, the results will appear.
